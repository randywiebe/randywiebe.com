                    <h4>Starting Out</h4>
                    <p>
                        When I started attending Brock University in 2005 I thought I wanted to be a chartered accountant. I completed two semesters, a four month
                        co-op term, another semester, another four month co-op term, another semester, and finally an eight month co-op term before I finally decided
                        accounting wasn't for me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So I enrolled in the Computer Science program at the University of Western Ontario. I spent my first year there as a part-time student,
                        completing the prerequisite courses I'd need for second year courses. I had seen the value of co-op programs (turns out they're just as good
                        for allowing you to realize what you won't enjoy as they are for giving you experience in a field you will enjoy) so I joined UWO's Science
                        Internship Program and accepted a sixteen month contract for a position with Phoenix Interactive Design, Inc (the internships range from
                        eight to sixteen months and are completed between third and fourth year).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The following is by no means an exhaustive list of my experiences and accomplishments as a developer, but it should convey an approximation
                        of my abilities.

                    <h4>Introduction To .NET</h4>
                    <p>
                        Most of the projects I had completed for school courses used Java. I had taken one course on C++ and no courses on C# prior to starting my
                        internship, I was a little apprehensive about working at a company where the products were developed using C++ and C#. My interviewers didn't
                        share my concern, telling me that transitioning from Java to C# would be easy. And it was. The syntax might have been a little different, but
                        C# was a strongly-typed, object-oriented language and I knew how to write that kind of code.
                    </p>

                    <h4>WinForms, WPF, &amp; WCF</h4>
                    <p>
                        Prior to my internship I hadn't really worked with user interfaces (UI). Course projects were run using a command line, so the learning curve
                        during my first few weeks at Phoenix was pretty steep.
                    </p>
                    <p> I learned about many of the different Windows Forms controls that come with the .NET
                        framework. I learned about using third-party controls and libraries, which hadn't really been necessary for the relatively simple code
                        required for course projects. I learned about data-binding to keep the UI and backend data in sync. I learned about using a data-access layer,
                        specifically EntityFramework, to load and save that backend data being manipulated by the UI. I learned about writing WCF web services to
                        access data when the data source (database, files, etc.) is not located on the same computer from which the UI is being run.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        UIs are great, but they're only one layer of a useful application. I had learned about code structure and organization in school, but once I
                        began working on real-world applications, the need for naming conventions and organizational standards was concretely reinforced in my mind.
                        Separating the code data-access layer from the layer of code that interprets/applies business rules from the layer that supplies data to the user
                        interface from the user interface layer makes for a much easier time maintaining and extending code.

                    <h4>C++ &amp; Win32 API</h4>
                    <p>
                        One of the more novel projects I worked on at Phoenix involved displaying a WPF window displaying data from a web service on top of a C++
                        application. The WPF component was fairly simple since it was used strictly to display information, so I set up the bindings and had it refresh
                        periodically to ensure the data displayed remained up-to-date.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The really interesting part was learning about how to get a reference to the window handle of the WPF window using the Win32 API so I could 
                        position the window where I wanted it, and then figuring out how to allow the threads to communicate without causing exceptions. After scouring
                        the internet and attempting some tests I realized it was as simple as marking the entry point of the WPF application with the [STAThread]
                        attribute.

                    <h4>Android</h4>
                    <p>
                        After I completed my internship I returned to Western for my fourth and final year. As part of the Software Engineering minor, I was required
                        to take a course called Software Maintenance and Configuration. This course ended up being a lot of fun, because to teach us about maintaining/
                        configuring software, the instructor split the class into two groups and assigned each to develop a module for Western's official app. One group
                        was responsible for the iPhone version of the app module, and the other group was responsible for the Android version (the Blackberry version
                        had been completed by a class the previous year). I was in the Android group.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I had written Java before, but never used the Android framework. Luckily their documentation and tutorials are very helpful and I was able to
                        get the Eclipse IDE installed and hooked up to our course SVN repository without too much trouble. We were given a list of requirements by our 
                        instructor and the address of a SOAP web service by Western's IT department where the information we required would be available.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The module we developed allowed students to find a place to eat on campus. The app displays a list of places to eat on campus, including
                        operating hours and distance relative to your location (if you have location services enabled). The information is retrieved from the web service
                        and saved in a SQLite database for better performance.

                    <h4>Silverlight</h4>
                    <p>
                        After graduating from Western with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Minor in Software Engineering, I accepted a position at 
                        <a href="http://www.camis.com/" target="_blank">Camis, Inc.,</a> where I've contributed to many different projects, including a Windows Forms
                        desktop application, a WPF/Silverlight out-of-browser desktop application, an ASP.NET web application, an ASP.NET MVC 5 web application, and 
                        an AngularJS web application.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Silverlight application was intended to be the next generation of interface for clients, until Microsoft announced support for Silverlight
                        would end in 2021. Even though plans are in place to replace it, it's still in use by some clients and needs to be supported so I've gained a
                        lot of experience implementing features and change requests using C#, WPF, Silverlight, and Telerik for Silverlight controls. This interface
                        communicates with the database via WCF service contracts so I've also gained some experience working with WCF web services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the more interesting tasks I worked on specific to this interface was creating a custom UI control based on a third-party control being
                        used. For security purposes, this application has a lock screen which is activated by a configurable period of inactivity (or manually enabling
                        it). The inactivity was tracked by running a timer that reset whenever an event took place (mouse click, key press, etc). There was one control
                        where events weren't resetting the timer because the events were being handled by the control internally, so I created a custom control that
                        used this third-party control as a base for all functionality except the input events, so that I could pass along to the lock screen timer
                        when an event had occurred.
                    </p>                    
                </div>                
                <div class="blog-post">
                    <h4>ASP.NET &amp; MVC 5</h4>
                    <p>
                        I also started to become more aware of specific design patters being used. I had learned about design patterns at Western, but during my
                        internship I was preoccupied with learning about the .NET framework and switching between projects so frequently I didn't pay as much attention
                        as I should have to the structure of the code. At Camis I've been able to spend enough time working with each product to note when patterns
                        like singletons and factories are used and why. The Silverlight application uses the model-view-viewmodel pattern and the data-binding abilities
                        of the WPF and Silverlight controls to keep data synchronized between the presentation layer and the data/model layer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the recent projects I've worked on at Camis was a web application created using ASP.NET and the MVC 5 framework. In addition to learning
                        about these technologies and the model-view-controller (MVC) design pattern, I was also able to expand my knowledge of more foundational web
                        technologies like html, css styling, and javascript.
                    </p>

                    <h4>AngularJS</h4>
                    <p>
                        The project I'm currently working on is an application that uses ASP.NET and the AngularJS framework. Camis' current generation of web interface
                        was built a long time ago and suffers from issues with the design that make it difficult to maintain and to use. The goal of this new
                        application is to address those problems by simplifying the design and improving the usability.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Maintaining and extending the product will be dramatically easier due to the use of a custom-developed code generation tool. The tool takes
                        a model written in C# and generates most of the code required client-side in Typescript using T4 templates. Generating Typescript instead
                        of Javascript allows developers to catch more errors at compile-time instead of run-time, so there is less risk of run-time issues caused
                        by mismatched types that could be missed during testing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The code generation tool generates the Typescript model, HTML view, and Typescript controller based on the property types, custom property
                        attributes, and custom class attributes supplied in the server-side C# model. To allow for customized behaviour in the controllers, the tool
                        actually generates a second controller which is an extension of the first that does not get regenerated when the tool is run so changes to it
                        aren't lost. The generated Typescript and HTML do all the basic work required to use the AngularJS framework, which will give developers
                        more time to develop features instead of spending time on setting up basic things like registering controllers and routes.

                    <h4>SQL</h4>
                    <p>
                        None of the projects I've worked on in the course of my career have been primarily focused on SQL development but many have required some,
                        usually in the form of an update to a table creation script or a stored procedure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One responsibility I was given in my first year at Camis that has taught me a great deal about database administration and SQL development was
                        the preparation of database update packages for our software releases. I use a database schema comparison tool to generate SQL scripts that,
                        when run, will update the database schema that exists in production to the database schema that exists in the software build we choose to
                        release.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The tool isn't perfect, so I double-check the generated scripts, make any necessary updates to ensure they'll run without error in our
                        production environment, and run them against a test database that is a backup of a production database.
