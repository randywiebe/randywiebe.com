                        Small updates today. I added a subheading that I thought was representative of myself and of this website.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also noticed that on a wider screen, two blog posts end up side by side before stacking vertically, which
                        gets confusing until you look at the dates.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My goal for today was to get the menu on the left working, so that content for each item on the list shows when that list item is clicked.
                        It didn't take long to get a basic script working, but it's not very extensible. Next time I think I'll make my goal improving the script
                        so that it takes in a parameter, finds and shows the element with that id, and hides everything else in the "main" div.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Small update: I was adding a bit of content to the other items and I realized that content for all the list items was showing every time I loaded the page.
                        I fixed it by setting the body onload() function to call the function that shows the content for this site but I don't know if that's the best solution.

                        I've spent a bit of time this weekend redoing this site.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I initially created the main page by copying and tweaking the jumbotron example from the Bootstrap site but realized I hadn't really learned anything about
                        designing and writing html using css styles. So, I started from scratch. The resulting page doesn't scale as nicely for smaller screens but at least
                        I'm learning.
                    </p>

                        I installed php on my computer and <a href="php-test.php">got it working locally</a> in preparation for adding a backend to this site. Initially I was thinking I'd
                        implement my own user credentials/login functionality, but then I remembered reading about <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-god-login/">the God login</a>
                        and decided to rethink my plans. I'll still need some way of mapping users to roles or permissions or something. Initially there won't be a reason for anyone
                        besides Dave to log in, but who knows what features the site will have 2, 5, or 10 years from now.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="blog-post">
                    <h4>2015-09-05</h4>
                    <p>
                        The purpose of this website was to allow my friend Dave to post content, and link to the content posted on his facebook wall to allow him to reach a wider audience.
                        The easiest way to post content is to edit the html directly, but that would require Dave to have access to the website's administrative account. Not that I don't trust him,
                        but handing out admin credentials is not a viable long-term solution.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The next step is to add a feature to the website that will allow visitors to sign up for accounts and log in on subsequent visits. The main goal will be to allow a certain role
                        to publish content, but users assigned to other roles could have additional privileges eventually. I'll also need a way to manage user roles, since I probably don't want
                        users deciding their own roles when they sign up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've started implementing a MySQL database. I have an initial design for users, roles, permissions, etc implemented, so the next step is adding the server and client-side
                        functionality that allows people to sign up and log in. Should be interesting.

                        I have a friend named David who posts a lot of really interesting environment-related stuff on facebook.
                        I know, another environmentalist/conservationist/biologist named David. That was actually the inspiration
                        for the name of the website I'll be maintaining for him.

                        Almost two years ago I met a young woman that I'm marrying in just over a year. I made a website where people can find information about our special day.
                        I'm planning to use the Google Maps javascript api for an interactive map that people can use to get directions without leaving the site. I'd also like
                        to add an RSVP form so that people don't have to mail their RSVPs if they'd prefer not to.
